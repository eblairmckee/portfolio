# Waddup?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) and my [Typescript Linaria template](https://github.com/eblairmckee/ts-linaria-template).

It also comes with Linaria and Font Awesome as well as [Wes Bos' eslint](https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos) config.

This project uses [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) to manage dependencies and run scripts.
