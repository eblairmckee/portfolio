          <h1>üëãüèº Hey, I'm Blair!</h1>
          <h2>I'm a frontend developer from Chicago</h2>
          <h3>I've been building things for the web for 5 years</h3>
          <p>
            Unlike most engineers, I was a Creative Writing major in college and kicked my career off as a marketing
            copywriter for a small tech startup outside of DC. I wanted to make sure my content was being presented the
            way I wanted on our websites... so naturally, I learned to code.
          </p>
          <p>
            I picked up WordPress soon after, and started freelancing custom websites for defense contractors. That
            naturally progressed into SPA development as React took the world by storm, and I moved out of static
            websites entirely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around that time, I landed my first full time developer job at a healthcare tech company, Rally Health,
            which recently was acquired by United Healthcare. There, I built admin tooling and learned how large-scale
            production applications were architected while we migrated from Angular 1 to React. But my favorite project
            was a service discovery catalog app (loosely based on Spotify's Backstage) that I got to design and build.
            And that's when my love for design systems exploded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not long after, I joined Coinbase's design system team and built out 7 cross-platform components and
            developed a system for SSR-friendly responsive styles (blog coming soon!). Recently, I was part of a
            multi-team effort to enable the new React Native Fabric architecture within our design system. I also helped
            design a "bootcamp project" program for new hires and mentored dozens of cohorts through their first 30 days
            at Coinbase.

            On the side, I enjoy building mobile and web apps. Lately, I've been deep diving
            <a href="https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
              React Native Reanimated
            </a>
            and a handful of different JAMstacks (like
            <a href="https://github.com/eblairmckee/pitterpatter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
              GraphQL + NextJS
            </a>
            ).
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my career I've been an active speaker sharing my work and learnings within internal communities
            and conferences, and on
