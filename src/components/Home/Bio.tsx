    <h1>👋🏼 Hey, I'm Blair!</h1>
    <h2>I'm a frontend developer from Chicago</h2>
    <h3>I've been building things for the web for 5 years</h3>
    <p>
      While working as a copywriter, I taught myself how to code, so I could control how my content was being presented
      on our websites. I picked up WordPress soon after, and freelanced websites and single page apps for defense
      contractors in my hometown of DC.

      I then landed a full time developer job at a healthcare tech company, Rally Health, which had just been acquired
      by United Healthcare. There, I built admin tooling and a service discovery catalog app (loosely based on Spotify's
      Backstage) that I got to design and build.

      Not long after, I joined Coinbase's design system team and built out 7 cross-platform components and developed a
      system for SSR-friendly responsive styles. Recently, I was part of a multi-team effort to enable the new React
      Native Fabric architecture within our design system. I also helped design a "bootcamp project" program for new
      hires and mentored dozens of cohorts through their first 30 days at Coinbase.

      Throughout my career I've been an active speaker sharing my work and learnings within internal communities and
      conferences.
